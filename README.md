# VSCode CSSTree Validator

An extension for Visual Studio Code that validates CSS according to W3C specifications and browser implementations.

[**View on Visual Studio Marketplace**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smelukov.vscode-csstree)

This extension highlights incorrect at-rules, properties, and values in your CSS files. It utilizes the [CSSTree](https://github.com/csstree/validator) capabilities to analyze CSS syntax and report any issues.

> **Note:** If you encounter false positives or false negatives—such as unknown properties being flagged or invalid values not being detected—please report these issues on the [CSSTree issue tracker](https://github.com/csstree/csstree/issues).

> **Note:** Currently, CSSTree does not support selector syntax matching. As a result, this extension does not validate selectors. Selector validation will be added once it becomes available in CSSTree ([see issue #34](https://github.com/csstree/csstree/issues/34)).

## Extension Settings

- `csstree.enable`: Enable or disable the CSSTree validator extension.

## Troubleshooting

To prevent overlapping warnings with VSCode's default CSS linting, you can disable the built-in linter by adding the following setting to your configuration:

```json
"css.validate": false
```
